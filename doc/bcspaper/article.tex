\abstract{Partridge is a system that enables intelligent search for academic papers. Here we describe how Partridge implements the automatic classification of the type of a publication. For each paper, Partridge automatically extracts the full paper content from PDF files, determines sentence boundaries, automatically labels the sentences with core scientific concepts, and then uses a random forest model to classify the paper type. We show that the type of a paper can be reliably predicted by a model which analyses the distribution of core scientific concepts within the sentences of the paper. We discuss the appropriateness of many of the existing paper types used by major journals, and their corresponding distributions. Partridge is online and available for use, includes a browser-friendly bookmarklet for new paper submission, and demonstrates a range of possibilities for more intelligent search in the scientific literature.}

%\abstract*{Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at \url{www.SpringerLink.com} and be available with unrestricted access. This allows unregistered users to read the abstract as a teaser for the complete chapter. As a general rule the abstracts will not appear in the printed version of your book unless it is the style of your particular book or that of the series to which your book belongs.
%Please use the 'starred' version of the new Springer \texttt{abstract} command for typesetting the text of the online abstracts (cf. source file of this chapter template \texttt{abstract}) and include them with the source files of your manuscript. Use the plain \texttt{abstract} command if the abstract is also to appear in the printed version of the book.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
Introduce paper search, CoreSC and SAPIENTA \cite{Liakata2012}, Partridge as a platform, and random forests as a technology 

%Use the template \emph{chapter.tex} together with the Springer document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content in the Springer layout.

%Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations. And please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:2}

Discuss in more detail how Partridge processes papers, how types were chosen, how papers were acquired and how the machine learning is conducted (features, algorithm, libraries, validation methods).

% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head


%Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
%\begin{equation}
%a \times b = c\;,
%\end{equation}
%
%however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray|
%environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option
%\texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape
%boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical
%subjects}.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%a \times b = c \nonumber\\
%\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
%\label{eq:01}
%\end{eqnarray}

%\subsection{Subsection Heading}
%\label{subsec:2}
%Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations} as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

%\begin{quotation}
%Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.
%\end{quotation}


%\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading}
%Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain \textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manucript. The sources\index{permission to print} must be acknowledged either in the captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}




%For typesetting numbered lists we recommend to use the \verb|enumerate| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\end{enumerate}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\end{enumerate}



%For unnumbered list we recommend to use the \verb|itemize| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development, cf. Table~\ref{tab:1}.}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\end{itemize}
%\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes coutcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{figure}[t]
%\sidecaption[t]
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the option graphics use
%\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
%\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
%\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}
%\label{fig:2}       % Give a unique label
%\end{figure}

%\runinhead{Run-in Heading Boldface Version} Use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

%\subruninhead{Run-in Heading Italic Version} Use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-refer\-ences and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}\index{paragraph}.


% Use the \index{} command to code your index words
%
% For tables use
%
%\begin{table}
%\caption{Please write your table caption here}
%\label{tab:1}       % Give a unique label
%
% Follow this input for your own table layout
%
%\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{2.4cm}p{2cm}p{4.9cm}}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:3}

Present the random forest results. Maybe also the clustering results. Include a few pie charts showing example distributions for typical papers from a few types. 

%\begin{description}[Type 1]
%\item[Type 1]{That addresses central themes pertainng to migration, health, and disease. In Sect.~\ref{sec:1}, Wilson discusses the role of human migration in infectious disease distributions and patterns.}
%\item[Type 2]{That addresses central themes pertainng to migration, health, and disease. In Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, Wilson discusses the role of human migration in infectious disease distributions and patterns.}
%\end{description}

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:4}

Discuss why it's possible to predict type from CoreSC, which classes are confused and why, which types are well defined by CoreSC. 

Discuss the potential for intelligent paper search opportunities in general and the future for Partridge.

%When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
